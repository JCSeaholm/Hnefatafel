# Hnefatafel
I'm implementing the game Hnefatafel in text with C. Just a little project to learn the language.
The rules are as follows:
- The game is played on an 9x9 grid.
- Player 1 starts with pieces in the middle of the grid, in a cross shape, their king taking the middle space.
- Player 2 starts with their pieces on the edges of the board.
- All pieces may only move vertically or horizontally, not diagonally.
- A piece may move as many spaces as the player wants, given it does not cross another piece.
- An opposing player may capture a piece by bordering it with two or more of their own pieces.
- The objective for Player 1 is to move the king piece to any of the four corners before it is captured.
- The objective for Player 2 is to capture Player 1's king.
